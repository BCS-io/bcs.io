Choosing em over pixel
  - with px if the user chooses to change the default font size of the browser (esp for people
    wanting accessability) then the media query would be unaffected. However, we want our
    media query affected by the font size.
  - em and rem are not affected by the root font setting (e.g. html { font-size: 62.5%; }
  - rems don't work in all browsers and ems are preferred
    - safari bug when people wrote about this - no idea if changed
  - My best understanding: Much of the space used up on webpage is with text. If the user
    changes the font-size then it will break the design. A larger font-size should give more
    space to the design. If someone changes the font-size from 16px to 20px then the
    breakpoint should be larger by 25% (20 / 16) for everything to fit in. EM will give you
    that as it's based on the font-size but pixels are absolute regardless of font.

  - EMs ARE PREFERRED

    0 - 600px:      Phone
    600 - 900px:    Tablet portrait
    900 - 1200px:   Tablet landscape
    [1200 - 1800] is where our normal styles apply
    1800px + :      Big desktop

    $breakpoint argument choices:
    - phone
    - tab-port
    - tab-land
    - big-desktop

    ORDER: Base + typography > general layout + grid > page layout > components

    1em = 16px
